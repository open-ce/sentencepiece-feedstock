  summary: "An unsupervised text tokenizer and detokenizer mainly for Neural Network-based text generation systems."
  description: |
      SentencePiece is an unsupervised text tokenizer and detokenizer mainly for Neural Network-based text generation 
      systems where the vocabulary size is predetermined prior to the neural model training. SentencePiece implements 
      subword units (e.g., byte-pair-encoding (BPE) [Sennrich et al.]) and unigram language model [Kudo.]) with the 
      extension of direct training from raw sentences. SentencePiece allows us to make a purely end-to-end system that
      does not depend on language-specific pre/postprocessing.
